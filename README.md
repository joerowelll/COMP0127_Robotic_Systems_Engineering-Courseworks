# COMP0127_Robotic_Systems_Engineering-Courseworks

Dependencies:
```
sudo apt install ros-melodic-controller-manager ros-melodic-joint-state-controller ros-melodic-effort-controllers ros-melodic-gazebo-ros-control ros-melodic-joint-trajectory-controller ros-melodic-velocity-controllers ros-melodic-ros-controllers ros-melodic-ros-control
```
Note:
In case you use the ROS distribution rather than melodic, e.g. noetic, you can change `melodic` in the command to match your distribution accordingly. Please also note that your ROS distribution has to be compatible with your Ubuntu version.
`sudo apt install ros-<distro>-controller-manager ros-<distro>-joint-state-controller ros-<distro>-effort-controllers ros-<distro>-gazebo-ros-control ros-<distro>-joint-trajectory-controller ros-<distro>-velocity-controllers ros-<distro>-ros-controllers`
